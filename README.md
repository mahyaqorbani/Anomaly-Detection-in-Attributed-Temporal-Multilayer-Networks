# Anomaly-Detection-in-Attributed-Temporal-Multilayer-Networks

Presented at INFORMS 2023 Annual Meeting. 

Focuses on identifying irregular patterns in complex network structures.
Employs state-of-the-art statistical machine learning algorithms for network analysis.
For a detailed overview of my research in anomaly detection, refer to the powerpoint file of my presentation at the INFORMS 2023 Annual Meeting.
